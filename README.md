1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   - The intent of the product was to allow a company to visualize customer purchase data in 3 different formats. The data came in the form of a text file and would then be ouput in one of three formats depending on the user's selection. The purpose of this was to help the company visualize how many products were being purchased.
     
2. What did you do particularly well?
   - What I did particurally well was the user interface. I utilized a console command that I learned on my own in order to clear the screen and keep it looking clean.
     
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   - I could add more input validation into the program. Some basic input validation was added, but it was not added throughout the whole program.
     
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   - The piece of code I found the most challenging to write was the file reading. It took a while to understand how to get the program to read and output the file contents correctly. A resource that I plan on adding to my support network is the excel sheet that I have been building throughout this course which acts as a repository for C++ syntax. It has been very helpful for quickly looking up syntax and I wish I had done the same thing for other classes.
     
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   - The skill I learned from doing this project that I find to be most helpful is essentially everything. This project required me to use almost every aspect of the material learned in this course and was great for helping me to solidify that information.
     
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   - I made sure to be consistent with spacing and naming conventions.

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   - The Gaming Room Client was a game development studio. They wanted a game software that could be ran across multiple operating systems.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   - I did a particularly good job identifiying the structure of the code. The part that I found to be most helpful when developing the code was the requirements. Having an outline of the requirements helped me to break down what (at a minimum) the code should do / support. 

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   - If I could work on one of the parts of the documentation to revise, it would be the requiements section. I would add more detail to the requirements.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   - It is important to consider the needs of the client so that as the software grows in complexity, the additions can be added to the program without having to rewrite existing code. 

5. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
   - When designing the software, I set up the code modularly. This is so that pieces of code could inherit from others and less code would have to be written overall. I will continue to make future code in this modular way.
