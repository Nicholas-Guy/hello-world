1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   - The intent of the product was to allow a company to visualize customer purchase data in 3 different formats. The data came in the form of a text file and would then be ouput in one of three formats depending on the user's selection. The purpose of this was to help the company visualize how many products were being purchased.
     
2. What did you do particularly well?
   - What I did particurally well was the user interface. I utilized a console command that I learned on my own in order to clear the screen and keep it looking clean.
     
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   - I could add more input validation into the program. Some basic input validation was added, but it was not added throughout the whole program.
     
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   - The piece of code I found the most challenging to write was the file reading. It took a while to understand how to get the program to read and output the file contents correctly. A resource that I plan on adding to my support network is the excel sheet that I have been building throughout this course which acts as a repository for C++ syntax. It has been very helpful for quickly looking up syntax and I wish I had done the same thing for other classes.
     
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   - The skill I learned from doing this project that I find to be most helpful is essentially everything. This project required me to use almost every aspect of the material learned in this course and was great for helping me to solidify that information.
     
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   - I made sure to be consistent with spacing and naming conventions.
